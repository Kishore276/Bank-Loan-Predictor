# Bank Loan Prediction App

This project is a simple web application for predicting bank loan approvals using a machine learning model. The app is built with Streamlit and uses a pre-trained model to make predictions based on user input.

## Features
- User-friendly web interface
- Predicts loan approval based on applicant details
- Uses a pre-trained machine learning model


1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the app:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run main.py
   ```

## File Structure
- `Bank_Loan_Prediction.py` : Main Streamlit app
- `Model/ML_Model.pkl` : Pre-trained machine learning model
- `bank.png` : App logo/image
- `requirements.txt` : Python dependencies

## Usage
- Open the app in your browser (Streamlit will provide a local URL)
- Fill in the applicant details
- Click 'Submit' to see the loan prediction result

## Notes
- The model is pre-trained; retraining is not included in this app.
- For development or retraining, use your own data and model pipeline.
